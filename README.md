# BackeTesting_Engine_For_Quantitative_Strategy
This project implements a from-scratch backtesting engine in Python to evaluate trading strategies on historical Bitcoin OHLCV data (2018â€“2025, multiple timeframes). It is intentionally compact but modular, making it easy to extend with custom strategies, execution logic, and risk management.
